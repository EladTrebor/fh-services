        <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Summary cards</h1>

        <p>If you’re showing multiple summary lists on a page, you can show each list within a <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list/#summary-cards">summary card</a>. This lets you visually separate each summary list and give each a title and some actions.</p>

        <p>Use summary cards when you need to show:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>multiple summary lists that all describe the same type of thing, such as people</li>
            <li>actions that will apply to all the items in a list</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Summary cards are often used in case working systems to help users quickly view a set of information and related actions.</p>

        <p>Do not use summary cards if you only need to show a small amount of related information. Use summary lists instead, and structure them with headings if needed.</p>

        <p>If you’re showing summary cards at the end of a longer journey, you might want to familiarise the user with them earlier on – such as when the user reviews individual sections.</p>

        <h2 id="card-titles">Card titles</h2>

        <p>Use the summary card’s header area to give each summary list a title.</p>

        <p>Each title must be unique and help identify what the summary list describes. For example, this could be the name of a specific person, organisation or professional qualification.</p>

        <p>Try to keep titles short and relevant. You can use one or two important values in the summary list – such as the first and last name of a person.</p>

        <summary-card title="Lead tenant">
            <summary-row key="Age" action1="Change" action1-href="#">38</summary-row>
            <summary-row key="Nationality" action1="Change" action1-href="#">
                UK national resident in UK
            </summary-row>
            <summary-row key="Working situation" action1="Change" action1-href="#">
                Part time – less than 30 hours a week
            </summary-row>
        </summary-card>

        <h2 id="card-titles">Adding card actions</h2>

        <p>You can add card actions in the header, which will be shown after the summary card’s title.</p>
        <p>For example, if you have multiple rows with “change” actions that all take the user to the same place, you can show a single “change” card action instead. This helps avoid repeating the same row action on every row.</p>
        <p>Card actions are shown in bold text to make them visually distinct from row actions – and help alert the user that the card action will affect the entire summary card.</p>
        <p>Write link text for card actions to tell the user what the card action will do and that it will apply to the entire summary card. It should also be as short as possible, usually 2 words.</p>
        <p>Example card actions include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Remove tenant</li>
            <li>Edit qualification</li>
            <li>Update issue</li>
            <li>Approve application</li>
            <li>Cancel order</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep it short and do not add more than 2 to 3 actions in a header.</p>
        <p>If a card action cannot easily be undone or might have serious consequences, consider adding a warning or asking the user for confirmation.</p>
